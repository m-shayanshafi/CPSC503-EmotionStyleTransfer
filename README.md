Download the emotion dataset here:

There is a script in the backtranslation/utils folder to convert from pickle to csv by class if needed.

There is also a constructVocab class in the same folder that is used to generate the vocab if needed. 

Sample script to construct vocab if needed is in classifer/emotion_classifier/getVocabulary.py
